The game control config is set as follows:

UP: "your character"
DOWN: "your character"
LEFT: "your character"
RIGHT: "your character"
EXIT: "your character"
MENU: "your character"

(Characters must be latin!)

WARNING:
If the config is set incorrectly (the file does not contain one of the prefixes,
the same button is set for two or more prefixes, a mistake is made in the name of the prefix, etc.),
then DEFAULT keys are set.

DEFAULT CONTROLS LOOKS LIKE THIS:

UP: w
DOWN: s
LEFT: a
RIGHT: d
EXIT: e
MENU: m
